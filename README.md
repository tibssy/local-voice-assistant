# local-voice-assistant

This project is a local voice assistant that operates offline, entirely independent of an internet connection. It uses pre-downloaded models to provide features like speech recognition, conversational AI, and text-to-speech synthesis.
Key Features:

    Offline Speech Recognition: Transcribes audio input to text using a local Whisper model.
    AI Chat Engine: Processes user input and generates responses via the Ollama model.
    Text-to-Speech Synthesis: Converts AI-generated responses to spoken audio using Piper voice models.
    Silence Detection: Automatically detects when the user stops speaking and processes the input.
    Exit Command: You can exit the conversation by saying “bye.”

Functionality:

The assistant listens for audio input, transcribes it into text, processes it using the AI chat model, and responds with synthesized speech. It provides a seamless and private interaction entirely on your local machine.

This assistant is ideal for those who value privacy, need an offline solution, or want to experiment with AI technologies locally.
